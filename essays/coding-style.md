# Rules to write codes? No way!
Wirting codes can be hard, but looking at codes and figuring out what is going on can be much harder, even if it is your own code. Codes get longer and longer as the project itself gets lorger. As I acquire the skills as a member of developers, it will be essential for me to be able to effectively, quickly, and correctly understand the code that I am looking at. But what could be one way I can assure that?

One way is to stick to a coding style. That way, I can remain consistent in terms of how I write codes. It is just simple; write codes within the rule called coding style. This helps people to write in the same manner so that even when programmers are working as a team, reading other people's codes won't be too harsh. I thought this as format in academic essays, which I really hated. I learned so much about MLA, which is one way to format an essay, but I still don't remember anything and every single time I have to write an academic essay, I have to search it up online and apply the rule to my essay, which will take me forever just for an essay.

# Wait, coding style is fun!
First time I heard about coding style, I was sad. I thought I wouldn't have to struggle to remember rules for writing codes and apply it to my code.
