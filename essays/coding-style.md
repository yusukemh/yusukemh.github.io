Wirting codes can be hard, but looking at codes and figuring out what is going on can be much harder, even if it is your own code. Codes get longer and longer as the project itself gets lorger. As I acquire the skill as a member of developers, it is essential for me to be able to effectively, quickly, and correctly understand the code that I am looking at. But what could be one way I can assure that?

Probably the easiest way is to stick to a coding style. That way, I can remain consistent in terms of how I write codes. You write codes within the rules called coding style. This helps people to write in the same manner so that even when programmers are working as a team, reading other people's codes won't be too harsh.
