## What is software engineering to me?
Software engineering is now very active and essential field in this world. Everybody is quickly and effectively connected via internet and a lot of big business is highly dependent on this field. It is no wonder I grew interest in software engineering given I have been surrounded by highly developed technologies. To me, software engineering is a field that can satisfy my passion, which is to keep learning something new. Programming languages are still developing and there is always something I need to learn. It is an endless pursuit of my interest and passion.

## How is this field appealing?
On of the most appealing points of software engineering is that it is an ultimate form of customization. Thanks to the nature of programming languages that there are a lot of variations in code, we can build a software and websites as we specifically want. What is more, to do so, all what we need is a laptop. This helps us to strengthen the ability to design and construct softwares with a diverse possibility. I believe learning how to implement the code so that the website looks exactly how I want is the most challenging, yet the most crucial skill that is required.

## What is my goal?
For now, my goal is to acquire the skill to develop a website. Developing a website is the closest way to get connected to the world and the way the website is designed really depends on whoever writes the code. Website is an easiest way to develop and express my skill to people. By knowing how to write properly and effectively, I believe I can fulfill this goal.
