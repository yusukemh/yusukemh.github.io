One of the most attracting features of Computer Science is that it is available to enybody. The resource is literally everywhere, there are plenty of free tutorials, and working environment with high technology, such as high-spec computers, highly developed softwares, and free online IDEs, is getting more and more affordable to everybody. This means that more and more people can develop the potential to become a programmer. Then, what is important in this era as one of the programmers? What makes you stand out among many other people who are also trying to be programmers?

Speaking of myself, I want to be able to connect Computer Science with other fields.
