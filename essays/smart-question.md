A famous proverb goes *Better to ask the way than go astray*. It says we need to ask when need to, or the consequence becomes bad. Yet, there are some people who do ask, *AND* go astray.  Well, it does sound a pity that someone needs help and ask for help, but he gets lost anyways. However, this is common on the Internet, and is really relevant to us as programmers.

One might say; thanks to the Internet, we can find anything on the Internet, and that’s the virtue of this field. Online resource is abundant. We have plenty of free online tutorials. Although this is convenient, sometimes you might face trouble and you may not easily find source that is specific to your situation. Why? It is because there are plenty of programming languages with different release version, and so are operation systems. What about the compiler? Sometimes even your IDE software can mess up with your code. Everybody works on a different environment, thus the variety of situation you face becomes too complicated and specific.

.By asking questions on the Internet, you can get more detailed information based on your situation that you face.

An American software developer, Eric Steven Raymond, gives you guidelines in his essay: “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”
