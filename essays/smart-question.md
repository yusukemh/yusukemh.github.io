A famous proverb goes *Better to ask the way than go astray*. It says we need to ask when need to, or the consequence becomes bad. Yet, there are some people who do ask, *AND* go astray.  Well, it does sound a pity that someone needs help and asks for help, but he gets lost anyways. However, this is common on the Internet, and is really relevant to us as programmers.

One might say; thanks to the Internet, we can find anything on the Internet, and that’s the virtue of this field. Online resource is abundant. We have plenty of free online tutorials. Although this is convenient, sometimes you might face trouble and you may not easily find source that is specific to your situation. Why? It is because there are plenty of programming languages with different release versions, and so are operating systems. What about the compiler? Furthermore, even your IDE software can mess up with your code. Everybody works on a different environment, thus the variety of situation you face becomes too complicated and specific. This is exactly why your question can be unique and specific, thus making it hard for you to find a detailed solution that works for you.

Lesson learned? Your question is special. Therefore you need to be good at describing your situation well. But how? Thankfully, an American software developer, Eric Steven Raymond, gives you guidelines about how to be good at asking questions in his essay: “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way.”
