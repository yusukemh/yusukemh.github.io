One of the most amazing features of software engineering is that we can code however we want, yet working completely. In other words, there are always other ways to code besides the "correct" answer, or the solution you just came up with. Well, is it really amazing? I would say no, because you could end up with the worst solution after dozens of trial of coding, not knowing there is one beautiful solution. What if there is already a guid which leads you to very rough, but yet effective solution? Wouldn't you start from the guide?

Design patterns are patterned types of structures of code, to cope with repetitive recurrence of problem solving. It describes some of the most commonly used approach towards problems solving in software engineering. Each design pattern has pros and cons that are well studied over time, so we as a coder can choose which design pattern to apply depending on the goal of your project.
