0 or 100. This, I believe, is the basic and the most fundamental principle when it comes to "automated" devices. 

Our life is becoming more and more convenient and efficient thanks to devices that can do jobs and decision making for human beings. Some involve simple programing while others have to deal with complex situations thus having to implement highly developed artificial intelligence. One example of the latter would be automated car driving system, which can instantly become controversial issue involving ethical consideration. 

[This article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/) gives you brief idea why automated driving systems have to deal with ethical issue. Briefly speaking, there are some situations where no sacrifice can be avoided on the road, and it becomes utterly complicated how the system has to be programmed to make decisions. For example, if there is a group of people walking on red in front of a vehicle, should the car keep going to kill them, or swerve to the side, which results in the driver's death even though it was totally pedestrians' fault for crossing on red? What if the driver is rushing to the hospital? What if there is another person on the side and the person has to be killed as a result of the car's swerving to the side? What if the crossing light was broken, thus pedestrians are actually NOT crossing on the red? 

Question can arise non-stop. The situation can be much complex with practically infinite number of possibilities.
