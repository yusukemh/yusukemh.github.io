## Introduction
Currently, during Spring 2019 semester, I am taking ICS 314 at University of Hawaii at Manoa. This is my first time to learn Javascript in my life, and this class requires me to interact with other classmates. This is only second week in the semester, but I have started realize couple of things about this course.

## About Javascript
Being a total amateur in Javascript, I still have a lot of fresh impression going around in my head. One thing I can clearly declare is that; although I like how Javascript can construct a website, *I don't like Javascript as a language at all, at least for now.*

I have learned how to code mainly in Java, C, and C++. Comparing to these languages, there are couple things that I would not prefer in Javascript. First, Javascript is weakly typed. Even working on codes for only couple of weeks so far, this really bothers me. It is because I am already so used to explicitly specify the datatype for *all* variables. In my opinion, specifying the datatype really helps coders to find bugs. If there is a variable, that variable has to keep the datatype, and should have somewhere in code where coder can refer to the datatype of the variable. However, what Javascript allows coder to do is to change the datatype of a variable or not to specify the variable's datatype anywhere in a code. What if. by mistake, a programmer assigns a value to a variable whose datatype is not appropriate for the value? The result will be unexpected to the programmer, yet the code compiles perfectly and won't show the programmer any error message. Just imagining this happening to me is enough to discourage me from using Javascript.

Another feature that I do not appreciate is the return type. As far as I understand from introductory tutorials of Javascript, functions in Javascript do not have to have a specific return type. This allows programmers to return values that are dependent on condition\: sometimes it can be string, and sometimes it can be an integer. I found this so confusing and vulnerable to bugs. I want functions to be specific, so that I am sure, no matter what, that the function always returns a value whose datatype is consistent.

## Other materials in this course
I had to admit that I don't like Javascript. Even though that is true, I like other materials in this course so far. I am all for the athletic software engineering. WOD, the abbreviation for "workout of the day," is a timed practice exercise of coding problems, and there are many WODs throughout the course so that students can exercise on those problems. My philosophy of coding is\: keep practicing before understanding. Sometimes it is very true that by the time I understand what I am doing, I am already able to write a code perfectly. This belief assists the way WOD is designed. Measure the time and write the code anyways.

I also like how each student is responsible for a lot of work outside the class. This is possible only because each student is always accessible to any sort of help any time through online resources and, most importantly, with other classmates via email, slack, or any other means of online communication. In my opinion, this clearly represents how people are strongly connected in actual workplace. By the time this course ends, I hope I have better understanding of how it is to work on a bigger project as a member of a group.
