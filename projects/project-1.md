In one of the Programming course at Kapiolani Community College, students had an individual project and I created a game where the game in Pokemon Go was simulated. For the whole semester, Java was taught by the professor using the concept of Pokemon. Students consequitively worked on creating classes of and for Pokemons. For the last component of the class, which was GUI using Java, each individual student wrote a code for the game. Since GUI was not deeply taught in class, I was expected to do a lot of research on my own to cmoplete the assignment. This helped me realize that there is plenty of resources available online, and it is not impossible, if anything, to teach myself how to write a code.

The requirement for the assignment was to simply create a random instance of a Pokemon and ask user to add to data structure with appropriate GUI provided for the user. However, As I worked on the project, I became more and more passionate and added many other features to my game. First, I made it posible for user to choose and keep a specific Pokemon as their partner. Then, instead of just adding another Pokemon to the data structure, I implemented the battle; user can now use the partner to fight the wild pokemon. Unless the wild pokemon is weak enough, and your partner Pokemon is still alive, the user cannot catch the Pokemon.

The code needed to be pretty complecated and long, so I spend significant amount of time for the project. As a result, I received an email from the professor, saying my game was one of the best that she had seen. 

Throught this project, I learned significant aspects about computer science; the accesibility of open resources and the endless possibility of implementation.
